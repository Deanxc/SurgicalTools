# SurgicalTools

The repository for the Surgical Tools project for EECS 498 - Software Systems.

We will be developing a HoloLens application for pediatric surgery.

******INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING ALPHA:
1) Install Visual Studio (preferably 2017)
2) Pull the project from Github
3) Go to SurgicalTools\SurgicalToolsUnity\App\ and click SurgicalTools.sln
4) It should open in Visual Studio
5) Set the three dropdowns at the top to Release, x86, and Device
6) Have the HoloLens plugged into the computer with a USB and have it paired already
7) Click "Debug" -> "Start without Debugging"
8) Let it run. If it breaks, switch from Release to Debug and run step 7 again
9) Once it works, it will render the dropdown on the HoloLens. 
10) Gaze at the arrow on the dropdown and pinch and release to click it. There is no cursor on screen so you have to trust your judgement
11) Select human, or scalpel to see examples of a human or a scalpel. Select others for shapes, or nothing (at the moment, for Alpha)
